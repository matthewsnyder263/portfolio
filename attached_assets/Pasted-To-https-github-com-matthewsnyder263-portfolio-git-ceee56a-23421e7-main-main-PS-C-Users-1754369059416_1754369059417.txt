You're almost there ‚Äî the last error is caused by having both functions and builds defined in your vercel.json file, which Vercel doesn't allow.

‚úÖ Fix Instructions
Open vercel.json (in your root project directory).

Remove one of the conflicting properties, based on what you're actually using.

If you're using Next.js, React, or another frontend-only framework:
‚û§ Remove the functions block.

If you're deploying a custom backend API (like api/contact.ts), you likely don‚Äôt need the builds block, and should remove it instead.

‚úÖ Example Fix: Remove builds (keep functions)
Here‚Äôs how your vercel.json should look if you're using functions:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "vercel-edge@2.5.2"
    }
  }
}
‚úÖ Example Fix: Remove functions (keep builds)
If you‚Äôre only doing a frontend build (e.g., using Vite or Next.js), your file might look like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "builds": [
    { "src": "package.json", "use": "@vercel/node" }
  ]
}
But in most modern frontend apps using frameworks like Vite/React, you don't need this at all.

üõ†Ô∏è After the Fix:
Once you fix vercel.json, redeploy:

bash
Copy
Edit
vercel --prod
Let me know which one you‚Äôre using (functions, builds, or neither) and I‚Äôll help you trim the file to fit.

Looks like you pinged ‚Äî if you're ready, send over your current vercel.json contents, and I‚Äôll tell you exactly what to remove or keep so you can finish your deploy cleanly.

Or if you're not sure which part of the stack you're actually using (e.g., custom API routes vs just a frontend build), I can help you sort that out too. Just let me know.

mine looks like this:

{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ],
  "functions": {
    "api/contact.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  }
}

Thanks ‚Äî now the error makes perfect sense.

You're using both "builds" and "functions" in your vercel.json, but Vercel doesn‚Äôt allow both at the same time. You need to pick one approach, based on what your project is doing.

‚úÖ Recommended Fix (based on your project):
Since you‚Äôre using a Vite static frontend build (distDir: "dist") and also have an API route (api/contact.ts), the proper setup is:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/contact.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 10
    }
  },
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "vite.config.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/vite"
    }
  ]
}
‚úÖ Use @vercel/vite instead of @vercel/static-build when you're using Vite and API routes.

üîÅ Alternative (if you‚Äôre not using serverless functions):
If api/contact.ts isn't actually being run as a Vercel function (e.g., you‚Äôre using an external backend), then you can remove the "functions" block entirely:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "dist"
      }
    }
  ]
}
Let me know which direction you want, and I‚Äôll confirm the final config for you.
